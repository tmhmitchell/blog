This book was a recommended read for a university module I took called "Computer Architecture and Systems Software 1". I recall a few friends and I (all taking that class, and being a bit naive)  ended up buying all the paperback copies on Amazon. Not because we're scalpers, mind, but because it's ~25 year old textbook - there just weren't many available. 

Given it was an older book, everyone else managed to get a copy for a single penny. I say everyone else because I was a bit slow to the draw - and ended up paying Â£20! Worst of all, I don't think I did anything more in-depth than skim read a few sections. Not my best purchase, that's for certain!
