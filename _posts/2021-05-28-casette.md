About a month or so ago, I discovered a genre called Dungeon Synth, thanks to a youtube channel called [The Dungeon Synth Archives](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChmm356a5qe1luUsoatAgjA) and  their upload of [Blood Lord's album Unwelcome Guests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD08jlE0af4).

As I explored, I came across [Spell of Unseeing's Weaving Light and Shadow](https://spellofunseeing.bandcamp.com/releases), and thougnt it was fantastic. I was going to buy the digital album, but noticed the physical release had an extra track. I couldn't pass up the oppourtunity to hear more!

With that said, I don't have a cassette player - yet! I'll have to wait a couple of weeks until I'm able to listen to the exclusive sixth track.
