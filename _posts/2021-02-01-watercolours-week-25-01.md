For context, I bought a cheap watercolour palete the weekend prior - two dozen colours and a few brushes for just over a tenner. They're not brilliant quality (I suspect there's more chalk in them than pigment), but I'm not particularly good at painting and wanted something cheap to have a mess around with. I cut an A4 sheet of "oil painting" paper into eight pieces, and tried to paint one little piece each day.
