I don’t usually go for darker beers, but since it was free I figured I’d experiment a bit. I was pleasantly suprised to discover May’s theme was Yorkshire! The following reviews are in the order I got each beer out of the fridge. That is to say that they aren’t in any specific order.Northern Monk - Eternal Waves - Session IPAQuite nice. I’ve not much else to say - as the can says, light and refreshing. I like it!North Brewing Co. - Full Fathom 5 - PorterAs above, I don’t usually go for porters, so this was a pleasant suprise. It’s made with coffee beans, so the rather forward coffee flavour makes sense. I’m also reminded of chocolate, vanilla and rum.Kirkstall Brewery - Perpetuous - Hazy Session IPANot sure about this one. It’s not unpleasant, but it’s quite… I think “dry” describes it best?Kirkstall Brewery - Dexter - Milk StoutYummy! Though if you didn’t tell me, I’d have thought this was a kind of obscure milkshake rather than a beer.North Brewing Co. - Analogue Set - Hazy IPAAlso quite nice. Slightly sour and citrusey. Good work, North Brewing!Brew York - Raspberry Pi(e) - Pale AleLight, sweet and refreshing. They’re not kidding when they say it tastes of raspberries! I’ve got a bit of a sweet tooth and enjoy Timmerman’s fruit beers, which this reminds me of. It’s good, although like Kirkstall Brewery’s Dexter, I’d hazard to call it a beer.Vocation Brewery - Naughty and Nice - StoutAs is expected of a chocolate stout, this tastes of 90% cocoa chocolate, which I enjoy. It’d be a nice pick-me-up over the colder months, I thinkTurning Point Brewery Co. - Hickory Clan Caviar - StoutNot for me. The beer’s inspirations (maple and pecans) do show through, but I think this is a little bit too experimental for my taste.",
